# First Time:
1. Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/
2. `cd` into your backend folder
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies (just Express for now)
4. (Optional, do with help). Install nodemon with `npm i -g nodemon` to automatically restart the server on save.

# Everytime:
5. Start the server with `node app.js`
6. Ctrl-c to stop the server/exit nodemon, ctrl-click the link to open in the browser.
